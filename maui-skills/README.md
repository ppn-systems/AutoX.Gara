## Installation

### GitHub Copilot CLI

Install the plugin from this repository:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add davidortinau/maui-skills
/plugin install maui-skills@maui-skills
/skills reload
```

Individual skills become available automatically based on your prompts.

### Claude Code

```bash
/plugin marketplace add davidortinau/maui-skills
/plugin install maui-skills@maui-skills
```

Skills load automatically when your prompt matches a topic — no manual selection needed.

### Manual (any tool)

Each skill is a self-contained directory with a `SKILL.md` file using standard YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`). Copy the directories into whichever location your AI tool reads skills from.

## Skill Format

Every skill follows the same structure:

```
maui-<topic>/
├── SKILL.md              # Skill definition with YAML frontmatter
└── scripts/              # Optional helper scripts
```

The `SKILL.md` file contains:

- YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields
- Detailed markdown guidance, best practices, and code examples
- Platform-specific notes for Android, iOS, Mac Catalyst, and Windows

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. To add or improve a skill:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Add or edit a skill under `plugins/maui-skills/skills/<skill-name>/`.
3. Ensure the `SKILL.md` has valid YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`.
4. If adding a new skill, add its path to `.github/plugin/marketplace.json` (GitHub Copilot) — Claude Code auto-discovers skills from the `skills/` directory.
5. Submit a pull request with a description of what the skill covers.

## Validation Tests

Each skill has been tested with a standalone .NET MAUI project that implements the skill's guidance and verifies it builds and runs correctly.

**Test suite:** [davidortinau/maui-skills-tests](https://github.com/davidortinau/maui-skills-tests)

All 37 skills build successfully for Mac Catalyst. Each test includes:
- Implemented skill code
- `REPORT.md` with validation results
- Manual runtime verification steps
